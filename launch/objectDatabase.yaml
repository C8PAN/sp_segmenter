# Choose the axis that needs to be consistent between runs
# by setting preferred.

# Pair width should be roughly half the extent of the visible object
# part. This means, for each object point p there should be (at least) one
# point q (from the same object) such that ||p - q|| <= 'pairwidth'.
# TRADEOFF: Smaller values allow for detection in occluded scenes but lead
# to more imprecise alignment.  Bigger values lead to better alignment but
# require large visible object parts.

# Voxel size is the size of the leafs of the octree, i.e., the "size" of
# the discretization. TRADEOFF: High values lead to less computation time
# but ignore object details, e.g., the method could not distinguish
# between a cylinder and an Amicelli box. Small values allow to better
# distinguish between objects, but will introduce more holes in the
# resulting "voxel-surface" (especially for a sparsely sampled scene) and
# thus will make normal computation unreliable. Processing time, of
# course, will increase with smaller voxel size.

# sceneVisibility aka Relative object size is the expected fraction of the scene points
# which belong to an object. For example a value of 0.05 means that each
# object represented in the scene will contain at least 5% of all scene
# points. TRADEOFF: lower values lead to more computation time and to
# higher success probability.

# Object visibility is the expected visible object part expressed as
# fraction of the hole object. For example 'objectVisibility = 0.1' means
# that 10% of the object surface is visible in the scene. Note that the
# visibility can not be more than 0.5 since a typical camera can not see
# more than the half of the object. TRADEOFF: smaller values allow for a
# detection in occluded scenes but also lead to more false positives since
# object hypotheses with small alignment with the scene will be accepted.
